A quick example of constructing paths with Raphael.  The path() function can accept an array describing
the path.  This helps make it easier to see the path definition as well as enable the possibility of writing
functions that can generate basic paths based on a set of inputs.  Other functionality in Raphael only works
with paths so it is desirable to use them when possible so these features are available.
